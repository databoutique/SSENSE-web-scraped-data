## About the website

[SSENSE](https://www.ssense.com/) is a leading international online retailer known for its curated selection of over 400 fashion and luxury brands. The Montreal, Canada based company was founded in 2003 by three brothers, Rami, Firas and Bassel Atallah. Despite their initial aim of creating a website design firm, it rapidly morphed into one of the most avant-garde fashion e-tailers. The privately-held company has not gone public, hence, details regarding stock market symbol, IPO date and market cap at IPO are not applicable. For more detailed information, the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ssense) and [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/0962658D:CN) page of SSENSE can be referred to.
